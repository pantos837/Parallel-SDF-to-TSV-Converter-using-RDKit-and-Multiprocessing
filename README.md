# Parallel-SDF-to-TSV-Converter-using-RDKit-and-Multiprocessing
This Python script leverages the RDKit chemistry toolkit and multiprocessing to efficiently convert chemical structure data from Structure Data Files (SDF) to a Tab-Separated Values (TSV) format. The conversion includes extracting compound IDs and SMILES representations of molecules.
